<h2 class="text" style="margin-bottom:5px;">Pre Made Web Design Templates</h2>

<p>Have you ever wondered "what skills do I need to become a web designer and start my own web design business"? Or maybe you are just thinking about earning some extra money with your new found knowledge of HTML but find the thought of creating a webpage design daunting.
Here is a little secret of web designers: Many don't design their clients' websites from scratch but purchase pre made <a href="http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=525643&u=66726&m=49649&urllink=&afftrack=">website templates</a>. Templates give designers a fast and easy way to build a client's website by simply adding the content to an already designed and built webpage. 
</p>

<p>
Web designers charge several hundred dollars for building a single website so the cost of a template is easily absorbed into the price of the web designer's fee. Website templates are fully customizable to meet clients' needs and there are an endless amount of designs to fit every kind of website, whether it's an e-commerce site for selling products online or a hobby site built on the Wordpress platform.
</p>

<p>
Using premade templates and some knowledge of HTML and CSS is the only requirement needed to get a web design business started. Any other skills you may have are an extra bonus.
</p>

<p>
Of course website templates are not just for web designers, they are also used by people who want to build their own website but don't have the creative flare to come up with a nice looking design. If you fall into that category, pre made <a href="http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=525643&u=66726&m=49649&urllink=&afftrack=">website templates</a> may be just the solution for you.<br /><br />
